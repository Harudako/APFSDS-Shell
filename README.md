<h1>Note</h1>
> Please read the ff:

• Please install the "Configurable Explosives Mod" in your PPG mod folder".

• Don't unfreeze the shell base because it might cause some bugs since this contraption isn't perfectly built yet.

• You can also try out the "Cannon Test" Contraption but you may encounter some bugs in it.

• You can mess around with it and distribute it to other people ;).
